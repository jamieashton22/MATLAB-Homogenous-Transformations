# MATLAB-Homogenous-Transformations
Creating a MATLAB script to compute homogenous transformations and DH parametrisation for a 3-DOF manipulator

As part of a Kinematics and Dynamics coursework that involved a 3-DOF elbow manipulator model in MapleSim, I created a MATLAB script to compute all homogenous transformations for the robot, and to compute its end-effector position. The outcome of this was to be able to compare the computed end-effector positions relative to the world-frame with those simulated in MATLAB.

This project served to deepen my understanding of kinematics and robotics, and to strengthen my skills in MATLAB, particularly in function syntax and matrix calculations. I aim to add functions to compute forward and inverse kinematics in given time. 

Status: as of 03/04/25 users can input some DH parameters (only those that the coursework required) and find the end-effector position. Next update will be editing the script so that users input all DH parameters.
Note this script only works for a 3-DOF elbow manipulator
